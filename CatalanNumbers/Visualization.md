### The catalan numbers are a sequence of positive integers that represent a special sequence that appears in a number of latice paths or combinatorics puzzles.
---

Suppose we are at a large party, and we would like to shake hands SIMULTANEOUSLY to someone else seated at our table.
The only condition is that we don't want our hands to cross. So suppose there are 4 of us in the round table,
 you do not want to shake hands with the person sitting diagonally opposite to you,
 because as you two shake hands, the other diagonal pair will try to too and your hands will cross.
